# CSCI4830-birthday_list_app
A simple Django application for the Spring 2025 session of CSCI4830. The application lets the user enter the birthdays of people they know, sort them by priority, and make note of potential gifts for each person. A list is created that is sorted in order by the date of each birthday for easier viewing. Each birthday can be editted, and more can be added.
